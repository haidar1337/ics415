# Assignment 1 - Basic Ray Tracer

## Task Overview
In this assignment, the goal is to build a simple **Ray Tracer** that can render three spheres on a 2D canvas. The program will simulate light rays and determine their intersections with the spheres, then assign the appropriate color to each pixel based on the sphere it hits.

### Key Requirements:
- Implement a basic ray tracing algorithm.
- Define three spheres with different colors.
- Compute the intersection of rays with the spheres.
- Color the pixels based on the nearest intersected sphere.
- Output the final image as a rendered scene.

---

## Output
Below is the final rendered image generated by the ray tracer:

![Rendered Output](assignment_1_output.png)

The image showcases three distinct spheres placed against a background, each colored based on the intersection logic implemented in the ray tracer.

---

## Running the Code
Refer to the main repository's installation guide to ensure you have Python installed. Then, navigate to the `assignment1` directory and run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will generate the output image as `assignment_1_output.png` in the same directory.

---

### Additional Notes
- The implementation uses basic mathematical principles for intersection detection.
- The output image is saved in `.png` format for easy viewing.
- Further enhancements, such as shading and reflections, can be explored in future assignments.
