# Project 2 - Shader Programming

## Task Overview
- **Three Large Spheres in the Center:**
  - **Metallic Sphere:** Reflects light with a glossy effect.
  - **Glass Sphere:** Demonstrates light refraction.
  - **Lambertian Sphere:** A matte surface with diffuse reflection.
- **Randomly Placed Spheres:** Populating the surrounding area to create a rich, complex scene.

### Key Features:
- **Material Rendering:** Different shading models for metal, glass, and diffuse materials.
- **Reflection and Refraction:** Accurate light interactions with the metallic and glass spheres.
- **Random Scene Generation:** A variety of smaller spheres scattered around the scene for depth and complexity.
- **Lighting and Shadows:** Enhances realism with proper shading and light interactions.

## Running the Code
This project uses a Shadertoy GLSL shader to render the scene. To run and view the shader:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com).
2. Click on "New Shader" and replace the default code with the provided GLSL code.
3. Press "Save" (you may need to create a free account) and the shader will render the scene in real time.
